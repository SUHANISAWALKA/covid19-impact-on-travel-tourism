# 🦠 COVID-19 Impact on Travel & Tourism: A Global Data-Driven Analysis

---

## 📌 Objective

The COVID-19 pandemic caused an unprecedented disruption in global travel and tourism due to lockdowns, travel bans, and evolving health protocols. This project explores how international and domestic tourism trends shifted between **2019 and 2023** using real-world datasets.

Through data analysis and visualization, we uncover the **depth of decline**, **recovery patterns**, and the **impact of factors** like **vaccination rates**, **government responses**, and **economic dependence on tourism**.
