# COVID-19 Impact on Travel & Tourism: A Global Data-Driven Analysis

## 📌 Objective
The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on global travel and tourism, disrupting international and domestic movement due to travel restrictions, safety concerns, and lockdowns.

This project aims to analyze the **decline, trends, and recovery patterns** in global tourism between **2019 and 2023** by leveraging data from trusted public sources. Through data analysis and visualization, we aim to uncover how different countries were affected, how quickly they recovered, and what factors (like vaccination or government policy) influenced this process.

## 📍 Key Questions
1. How did international tourist arrivals change globally during COVID-19?
2. Which countries/regions experienced the sharpest declines?
3. How did vaccination rates impact the recovery of tourism?
4. When did recovery begin in different countries?
5. What insights can help predict future resilience in tourism?

## 🛠️ Tools Used
