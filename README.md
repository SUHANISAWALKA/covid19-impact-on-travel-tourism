# 🦠 COVID-19 Impact on Travel & Tourism: A Global Data-Driven Analysis

## 📌 Objective

The COVID-19 pandemic caused an unprecedented disruption to global travel and tourism, driven by lockdowns, travel bans, and evolving health protocols. This project investigates how international and domestic tourism trends changed between **2019 and 2023** using real-world datasets.

By analyzing key metrics across countries and time, we explore the **depth of decline**, **trajectory of recovery**, and the **influencing factors** like **vaccination rates**, **government policies**, and **economic dependencies on tourism**.

## ❓ Research Questions

- 🌍 How did international tourist arrivals change globally during COVID-19?
- 📉 Which countries or regions experienced the sharpest declines in tourism?
- 💉 What role did **vaccination rates** and **government response measures** play in tourism recovery?
- 📆 When did signs of recovery begin in different regions?
- 🔮 What patterns can help **predict future resilience** or vulnerability in the tourism industry?

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python**: Data cleaning and analysis using `Pandas`, `NumPy`
- **Visualization**: `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn` for plotting trends and comparisons
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For an interactive and documented analysis workflow
- **Power BI** *: To create an interactive dashboard with filters by country and year
- **Git & GitHub**: Version control and collaboration

## 📊 Datasets Used

- UNWTO (United Nations World Tourism Organization) Tourism Statistics  
- Our World in Data – COVID-19 Vaccination Rates  
- World Bank – GDP contribution from tourism  
- Government Policy Index (Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker)

> ✅ All datasets were merged and cleaned to create a multi-dimensional view across time and countries.

## 📈 Key Insights

- 🌐 Global tourism dropped by **74% in 2020** compared to 2019.
- 🏖️ Tourism-dependent economies like **Thailand** and **Spain** saw deeper and longer declines.
- 💉 Countries with faster vaccination rollouts (like UAE, Israel) witnessed **quicker recovery** by late 2021.
- 💰 Recovery was slower in countries with **strict long-term lockdowns** but picked up sharply post 2022.
- 📅 Full recovery to pre-pandemic levels began for most developed countries in **late 2022 – early 2023**.

## 📌 Objective

The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on global travel and tourism, disrupting international and domestic movement due to travel restrictions, safety concerns, and lockdowns.

This project aims to analyze the **decline, trends, and recovery patterns** in global tourism between **2019 and 2023** using data from credible public sources. Through data exploration and visualization, we examine how different countries were affected, how quickly they recovered, and what factors such as **vaccination**, **government policies**, and **economic tourism dependence** influenced this recovery.
