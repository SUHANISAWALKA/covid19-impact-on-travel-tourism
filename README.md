# 🦠 COVID-19 Impact on Travel & Tourism: A Global Data-Driven Analysis

---

## 📌 Objective

The COVID-19 pandemic caused an unprecedented disruption in global travel and tourism due to lockdowns, travel bans, and evolving health protocols.  
This project explores how international and domestic tourism trends shifted between 2019 and 2023 using real-world datasets.

Through data analysis and visualization, we uncover the depth of decline, recovery patterns, and the impact of factors like vaccination rates, government responses, and economic dependence on tourism.

## ❓ Research Questions

- 🌍 How did international tourist arrivals change globally during COVID-19?  
- 📉 Which countries or regions experienced the sharpest declines in tourism?  
- 💉 What role did vaccination rates and government response measures play in tourism recovery?  
- 📆 When did signs of recovery begin across different regions?  
- 🔮 What patterns may help predict future resilience or vulnerability in the tourism industry?
