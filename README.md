# 🦠 COVID-19 Impact on Travel & Tourism: A Global Data-Driven Analysis

---

## 📌 Objective

The COVID-19 pandemic caused an unprecedented disruption in global travel and tourism due to lockdowns, travel bans, and evolving health protocols. This project explores how international and domestic tourism trends shifted between **2019 and 2023** using real-world datasets.

Through data analysis and visualization, we uncover the **depth of decline**, **recovery patterns**, and the **impact of factors** like **vaccination rates**, **government responses**, and **economic dependence on tourism**.

---

## ❓ Research Questions

- 🌍 How did international tourist arrivals change globally during COVID-19?
- 📉 Which countries or regions experienced the sharpest declines in tourism?
- 💉 What role did vaccination rates and government response measures play in tourism recovery?
- 📆 When did signs of recovery begin across different regions?
- 🔮 What patterns may help predict future resilience or vulnerability in the tourism industry?

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Google Colab**: For cloud-based notebook execution  
- **Python**:
  - `Pandas`, `NumPy`: Data cleaning and preprocessing  
  - `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`: Data visualization  
- **Power BI** *(optional)*: Interactive dashboard with country/year filters  
- **Git & GitHub**: Version control and collaboration

## 📊 Datasets Used

- **UNWTO** – International tourist arrival data  
- **Our World in Data** – COVID-19 vaccination rates  
- **World Bank** – Tourism’s GDP contribution  
- **Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker** – Policy stringency index  

> ✅ All datasets were cleaned and merged into a unified, country-wise, multi-year format for comprehensive analysis.

## 📈 Key Insights

- 🌐 Global tourism fell by **74% in 2020** compared to 2019.
- 🇹🇭 Countries heavily reliant on tourism (e.g., **Thailand**, **Spain**) saw **deeper and prolonged slumps**.
- 💉 Countries with **rapid vaccination rollouts** (e.g., **UAE**, **Israel**) saw quicker recovery starting late 2021.
- 🔒 Nations with **extended lockdowns** faced slow rebounds until mid-2022.
- 📅 Most developed countries approached **pre-pandemic tourism levels by late 2022–early 2023**.
